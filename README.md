# laser_capture_microdissected_islet_transcriptomics
This repository contains scripts and files related to laser-captured islet transcriptomics of nPOD donors across four clinical phenotypes: non diabetic (ND), single auto-antibody positive (sAAb), multiple auto-antibody positive (mAAb) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients. 
Laser-captured islets from fresh frozen slides were immunostained for insulin (INS), T-cell infiltration (CD3), antigen presentation (HLA Class I) and mitochondrial function (ATP5B).
